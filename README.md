# Hello World of Builders
### This is why we Exist
- Manufacturing is an important enabler of economic growth that represents hundreds of billions of market cap.
- Metal 3D printing is antiquated. Data is now proliferating in ways that can accelerate capability and control physics.
- We need to move from a world of static, fixed tooling approaches that are unable to adapt for long-term production resilience to agile, intelligent systems that can produce any range of outputs, based only on input.
- Additive manufacturing can deliver incomparable levels of efficiency, as well as support significantly more complex designs in practice that expand the reaches of human experience and complex systems.
- Incumbents ignore the need for root, whole-picture innovation beyond that which is capable of WAAM or DED. This form of innovation must be engineered and it must emerge from the United States.

##### ***It is important that this occurs. We seek to harness profound advances in materials science and automation in order to create creators.***

##### Additive systems that are capable of extremely potent physics-based command are made in our eyes by test heritage at scale by means of solely electrical affectors of a direct nature (no optical or laser-based heating), trained by reinforcement learning and operating with minimal intervention latency from code. Each of these factors are accelerated by the use of in-house developed architectures. In the context of manufacturing systems at large, such an objective could only be conducted using an additive approach, rather than any approach that is subtractive, forging or casting based, or that is reliant on a lossy medium of interaction with the environment around it such as laser-based heating or any machine tool. We believe additive is primitive as an industry; and as we release innovation over time, in terms of hardware, software, and accessiblity, this industry will reach general-purpose usability.

##### [Rosotics Corporation](https://www.rosotics.com) is an early-stage startup company founded in 2019 in order to accelerate this mission. We develop, build, and operate the largest metal 3D printers in the world, for the aerospace, naval, and defense industries. We see the challenges ahead of us not as barriers, but as invitations to create enduring solutions that have the ability to alter how we interface between the digital and physical world. Our architectures are designed to render alternative options exorbitantly expensive and complex by comparison. We do see our architectures as a template for others to follow — hence our existence on this site — and we invite others to follow. We work to introduce technologies that have the weight to advance our industry as a whole.

### This is why you've reached GitHub
##### You're here for one of three reasons - 1) You know our systems well, 2) You know us well, or 3) You want to know what we do. We've moved our real-time presence to GitHub in order to maximize transparency and because we believe in the concept of open-source documentation. On this repository and those that accompany it, you will see how things change over time, you can suggest improvements, or even take some of our ideas and make them your own to create something useful in other contexts. You can also rely on these repositories to more quickly access support and better learn how our hardware and our software operates, before, during, or after you decide to give our systems a try. We're grateful you may take the time to read these repositories to learn more about us, and we want to extend that extra layer of trust by making it more accessible for everyone here on GitHub.

### Join Us
##### Internship — We run programs in the Summer and in the Fall. Please reach out to team members individually if interested.
##### Most roles at Rosotics are engineering-oriented as we are a startup company working to answer fundamentally challenging questions in materials science. Our interns have graduated to either full-time roles or have entered positions at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com), [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com), [Relativity](https://www.relativityspace.com), [RTX](https://www.rtx.com), and [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com). We are location and education agnostic, with most interns relocating from out of state from institutions such as [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu), [MIT](https://www.mit.edu), and [Embry-Riddle](https://erau.edu). Do not feel you need experience to apply, we encourage you to apply regardless. We are often the first internship on resume, and we are proud to be that first 'yes'. For full-time opportunities, visit here to view currently [open positions](https://rosotics.rippling-ats.com).
##### (While we look for many engineers, we do recognize talent where we see it. Please reach out if you believe another role could be useful to our mission)

### Questions?
##### You can reach us regarding any technical, corporate, or production related matters [here at this site](https://www.rosotics.com/contact).
##### For more urgent matters that require immediate assistance, visit the Manual for [documentation](https://www.rosotics.com) or contact info@rosotics.com.
##### (Chances are we can answer your question faster by this Manual, e.g., "how do I diagnose this issue?", so we try to keep it easy to navigate)
