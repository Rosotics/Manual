## Our Ethos

Our team works to cultivate the field of metal additive manufacturing and by proxy introduce the most significant advancements in industrial robotics of our generation. By mission; to create unparalleled systems that propel economic growth and support dual-use and national defense capabilities.

We are relentless in our pursuit of excellence, leveraging AI in sequence with complex materials science to dominantly command the physics of manufacturing. We view these challenges as calls to innovate, compelling us to establish platforms that broaden capability in the physical world. Rosotics stands to lead the charge into a future where process sets standard.

We harness the transformative power of such innovations to create systems of extraordinary capability, and invite the world to witness us.

## What is Rosotics?

[Rosotics Corporation](https://www.rosotics.com/) is structured to drive innovation and excellence in metal additive manufacturing. Founded in 2019, we are an early-stage startup headquartered in Mesa, Arizona, comprised of engineers, scientists, and industry veterans. We are conviction-led and founder-led, as well as the first to have bet on induction-based metal 3D printing due to our recognition of it as the most [code-responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)) method to 3D print any metal.

Our organizational structure is designed to foster collaboration and agility. We believe strongly in the concept of iterative development and competitive design - we examine each option thoroughly to a given question by means of placing each option in competition with each other in a real world testing environment. We believe in [modular design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_design) as well, and operate distinct internal teams for process development and systems development, which interchange our mainline capabilities as concepts advance to service without necessitating entire system redesigns. Our offerings are designed to upgrade rather than degrade over time, as a result of modular design principles at forefront.

Our research and development (R&D) department is our backbone, and we investigate advanced projects as well. These teams are responsible for pioneering new architectures for direct application in manufacturing and continue to refine our existing processes. They work closely with AI and materials science expertise to integrate and amplify.

The production department at Rosotics handles the assembly, Q/A and checkout of metal 3D printers. This team ensures that our systems are manufactured to the highest standard and are capable of meeting the rigorous demands of our customers in the aerospace, naval, and defense sectors.

As we are still small and nimble, each system deployed in field is supported by direct service support from an engineer that worked to engineer and build your exact serial number, which works with an intricate understanding of machine and process, to ensure that our systems are implemented effectively and operate smoothly.

In addition to our internal structure, Rosotics has a strong focus on partnerships and collaboration. We work with leading academic institutions, research organizations, and industry partners to stay ahead of the curve and continuously improve our offerings.

Our corporate culture is built on a foundation of innovation, excellence, and resilience. We encourage our team members to think creatively, challenge conventional wisdom, and reject the boundaries of what is today possible in metal additive manufacturing. This culture of innovation is what drives us forward and supports our stance as the leader of our field.

## Our thoughts on the future of AI

To be clear, we are not developing or addressing the question of artificial general intelligence (AGI), but more so actively attempting to generate and deploy a more real-world derivative that could be used for work in secure manufacturing environments. We consider this to be a layer in subordinate command over hardware systems that can safely possess autonomy in order to intervene within the laws of physics, such as in complex metallurgical or superheated fluid behavior. We have a number of thoughts on this topic.

### General Considerations

Our stance on AI, which we term as the 'Phoenix Razor' is framed on three assumptions:

1. In the near term, the capability of AI will advance in the context of accelerating returns [(Kurzweil)](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/10600). This will be compounded by [positive feedback loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback), [emergent behaviors](https://tedai-sanfrancisco.ted.com/glossary/emergent-behavior/), and [evolutionary principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) - this was reinforced at the introduction of GPT-4 in March 2023.
2. Given enough cycles of iteration and not likely very many, an AI will soon exhibit the ability to dominantly command materials science.
3. Given condition 1 and 2 are met, you are faced with only three options - be bankrupted in competition against that AI, prevent it from being created, or be first to create it.

I met with my co-founder (Austin) over lunch in March 2023 to decide on this stance, and we determined the only true option on the table is to aggressively create and constrain it, with a paramount objective of deployment within 18 months. As a VC-backed (well capitalized yet still narrow in focus + nimble) startup company, this would best limit the potential for a large multinational industrial conglomerate with a presence on multiple continents to deploy an architecture such as that described in condition 2 [that could be stolen by](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/microsoft-says-it-caught-hackers-china-russia-iran-using-its-ai-tools-2024-02-14/) or otherwise reluctantly allowed to end up in the hands of hostile nations that have utilized AI [to push geopolitical agendas](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/14/23794974/china-generative-ai-regulations-alibaba-baidu) or actively exploit AI [for abuses](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-02-26/us-china-artificial-intelligence-uighurs-surveillance) to personal liberty and self-determination. A technology such as that which we describe would provide unprecedented capabilities in the domains of manufacturing and industrial intelligence; and we believe it must be developed and deployed for the benefit of all nations in a commercial context.

Additionally, we believe in addressing the razor we are unique in time to deployment. The razor is predicated on all points in regard to time and irrelevant to our stance in a dynamically moving parallel market - but in specific, time to deploy. If any entity is to deploy within 18 months which holds preferable characteristics (small capitalization, domestic, narrow) it will need to be without margin for failure in late stages of development, post-MVP, and at a market readiness state. This is in reference to additive hardware and software development, process development, and market stance. It must also be a 'first' product introduction, or an initial launch of said platform, to a mature and directly relevant pipeline. In this respect, we consider the razor best addressed by an entity as we are, in reference for the betterment of humanity.

### Defining the LLM Interconnect

What we usually think of as artificial intelligence in the post-GPT era today — are LLMs. These are suspected in practice to lead us towards semi-sentient networks that may transcend the limitations of software, and potentially command real-world machines in their entirety that perform industrial work. This condition does NOT exist anywhere on Earth yet. What we have for practical AI today is highly advanced, yet narrow, Deep Learning (DL) algorithms that benefit from computation in order to apply deduced networks to unknown data, which sometimes are and sometimes aren't connected to hardware. These algorithms can however be supercharged, in a sense, by providing them access to what I term as 'LLM interconnects', essentially, a base-layer text-state collection of “highways” to interconnect foreign API code bases that machines such as industrial robots operate upon. For example, ROS running a number of industrial robots in direct communication with the NX software containing your CAD assembly. Distinct algorithms would utilize these interconnects as part of a base-layer text-state capable of translating foreign I/O for direct communication, such that to circumvent user interfaces, while in base-layer performing extremely elaborate pattern recognition and statistical modeling.

We term this base-layer, containing any number of LLM interconnects as 'Rosetta'.

Neural Networks emerged out of the principle that the brain, and neurons, work as a collective network based on frequent communication at synapses. This is true. It is well established and supported in research that the brain is able to operate so efficiently because it practices mass parallelization, and distribution between neurons. However, neural networks (forms of replicating this process algorithmically) are flawed in the sense that thinking of the brain as a ‘system’ at any given point, even momentarily, is false — the brain is more of a collection of processes that routinely change themselves and modify their functions in order to achieve goals. No matter how complex we architect neural networks, or train them with supercomputers, they will at best, only be very fine grained simulators of human-like thought processing at a particular instant. Thought is a piece of a very large puzzle. Thought is not subjective or experiential. Practical, industrial applications would need to understand and subjectively infer that base physics is constant and everything above that in reality will move.

To go beyond where we are today with industrial AI, to reach or pass the threshold of comprehensive physical intelligence, and create a system capable of commanding manufacturing processes in the real world will require in our opinion the ability to quickly perceive environmental cues from multi-modal sensory, independently derive base physical concepts from significant reinforcement learning heritage and then distribute respondent I/O on the basis of LLM interconnects (so it can act on a non-statistical basis). It needs to be able to understand the events and repercussions of physical actions, and the material behaviors it encounters. It needs to be able to utilize LLM interconnects to form the basis of communication logic and build physics-based deduction from sparse information (gained over thousands, if not millions of iterations in the physical environment). To build this, the good news is that we do not need to build better neural networks that more closely simulate the action of neurons in the brain. We need to develop just the opposite, radically simple — almost binary, networks residing in embedded chipsets and place extremely large numbers of these networks without defined relation to any other such networks in a hardware environment, in which these binary networks are capable of interacting with each other and quickly building intuition. They will select and propagate bits of information, forming and storing concepts organically, and using LLM interconnects will allow the networks to command and control both sensory input and responsive control. This interconnectedness, in theory, will be what we would consider the actual ‘intelligence’. This chipset will be in ample control over hardware and materials science, rather than a software backend.

Industrial AI that is capable of extremely potent physics-based command is found in mass physical deduction from full destructive testing by means of solely electrical affectors (no optics, it must be largely lossless), trained by self-reinforcement and organic binary propagation of reasoning through LLM interconnects to foreign APIs. This reasoning will be amplified and accelerated by the horsepower of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). In the context of a manufacturing system, this would have to be conducted using an additive approach, rather than any approach that is subtractive, forging or casting based, or that is reliant on a lossy medium of interaction with the environment around it such as a laser or machine tool. It must utilize superheated fluid as the control point of effect, manipulated only electrically, in order to achieve the responsiveness required.

In other words,

The solution to winning the razor isn’t requisant on stronger algorithms, it’s about creating effective channels of dialogue between many weak, responsive ones and supplying fairly moderate levels of GPU compute to high-speed sensory inputs. If metallurgical control is desired, only an electric field in base level physical control, not even a pre-trained master algorithm with laser affection could do it.

### The Intersection of AI and Complex Materials Science

The convergence of these innovations and complex materials science is driving a significant transformation in how we create in the physical world. At the forefront of this shift will be the deployment of deep learning algorithms and large language models (LLMs) that collectively enhance material discovery, process optimization, and manufacturing efficiency.

Deep learning algorithms are revolutionizing how we characterize material behaviors. By implementing multi-modal sensory to produce vast datasets and mine this data in real-time, these algorithms can identify off nominal material behaviors and intervene for in-process correction with remarkable accuracy. This approach accelerates the taming process of advanced alloys for printer integration that are tailored for specific applications, reducing the time and costs traditionally associated with experimental methods.

In parallel, we recognize AI-driven models in process control are able to further optimize significantly higher deposition-rate processes in metal additive manufacturing such as that the Induction Overture Nacelle (ION) head performs. These control models adapt various conditions and parameters to optimize deposition rates, thermal gradients, and refrigerant flow rates into ION. Such optimization ensures process stability and that produced components exhibit superior mechanical properties and structural integrity, pushing beyond the limits of conventional manufacturing methods. Reinforcement learning allows for the training of these control models for service on platforms such as Halo. These systems continuously learn and improve from real-time process feedback, dynamically tapering parameters to maintain optimal performance. Central to this integration of Rosetta derived control code is the use of in-house developed hardware architectures that facilitate the application of derivations. This closed improvement cycle ensures that manufacturing processes are consistently performing and offer the potential to reduce reliance on human-machine interfaces (HMIs) such as a user interface or teach pendant. Our systems and the Halo platform are objectively designed with these elements designed to be eliminated as we further qualify our firmware backends.

### Minimizing Human Intervention in Manufacturing Environments

Minimizing human intervention in manufacturing environments is essential for improving safety and efficiency. With the integration of AI and automation, we can significantly reduce the risks associated with human involvement in hazardous tasks, enhancing both worker safety and operational productivity. Industrial environments are inherently risky, with the [Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/osh.pdf) reporting over 2 million non-fatal workplace injuries and illnesses annually in the United States, a significant portion of which occur in the manufacturing sector. These injuries are often caused by repetitive motions, exposure to operational hazards, and operating dangerous machinery (such as welding equipment, or a laser-based printer).

Reducing human involvement in these high-risk areas can dramatically improve safety. Intelligent control algorithms allow Halo to effectively manage tasks involving high temperatures, heavy loads, or process monitoring, effectively removing workers from situations where they could be exposed to hazards. For instance, musculoskeletal injuries, which the National Safety Council identifies as [accounting for 30% of all workplace injuries](https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/work/work-overview/top-work-related-injury-causes/data-details/), can be significantly reduced by automating processes such as drum welding or system priming. This shift not only protects workers directly but also limits fringe factors which could present variance to the print environment.

Automation and AI also play a pivotal role in enhancing operational efficiency. Our platforms are designed to operate continuously at high temperatures without the need for breaks, maintaining consistent productivity levels and eliminating human limitations such as fatigue and distraction, which can lead to errors and accidents. Additive systems with intelligence-driven control stacks are able to continuously monitor and optimize manufacturing processes in real-time, ensuring maximum efficiency and quality control.

Predictive maintenance also plays a critical role in minimizing human intervention. Advanced algorithms within Halo are able to analyze data from embedded sensors to predict failures before they occur. This capability reduces unexpected downtime and maintenance costs, ensuring that equipment operates smoothly and safely. [According to a McKinsey report](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/manufacturing-analytics-unleashes-productivity-and-profitability), predictive maintenance can reduce machine downtime by 30% to 50% and extend the lifespan of machinery by 20% to 40%.

With fewer humans involved in these tasks, the requirement for personal protective equipment (PPE) is also reduced. This not only lowers costs but also simplifies the logistics of managing PPE supplies and further enhances safety by minimizing the potential for human error in using PPE correctly.

It is our stance that these architectures provide unparalleled precision and consistency in the manufacturing environment. The presence of intelligent algorithms utilizing LLM interconnects within Halo ensures that operations are streamlined and waste can be minimized. This is our vision for an industry that is safer, more capable, and more sustainable.

### Addressing the Ethical Considerations of Industrial AI

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into industrial settings brings forth a host of ethical considerations that must be addressed to ensure responsible and equitable implementation. As AI becomes increasingly prevalent in manufacturing, it is crucial to navigate these ethical challenges thoughtfully, balancing technological advancement with the societal impacts we anticipate them producing.

One of the foremost ethical concerns is the transparency and accountability of AI systems. As AI-driven decisions increasingly influence manufacturing processes, it is imperative that these systems operate with a high degree of transparency and with appropriate guardrails to override. Every system we produce has the means for manual control. In addition, customers are informed with a clear understanding of how our algorithms make decisions, particularly in areas such as process control and predictive maintenance. Ensuring that AI systems are explainable and that their decision-making processes can be audited is essential for maintaining trust and accountability. This transparency is not only important for operational integrity but also for regulatory compliance and ethical governance.

Data privacy and systems security are also paramount in the ethical deployment of industrial AI in the sectors we operate within. The vast amounts of data generated and processed by our systems in-process can include sensitive information about operations, products, and personnel. Protecting this data from unauthorized access and ensuring its ethical use is crucial. We maintain robust data governance frameworks that are established to safeguard privacy and ensure that data is used responsibly and does not leave the system level. This includes implementing stringent cybersecurity measures and adhering to data protection regulations to prevent misuse.

The ethical use of AI in these environments also involves ensuring that our algorithms are designed and deployed to [seek physical truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) and avoid biases. AI algorithms can inadvertently perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases if not properly managed. For example, biased data used in training AI models can lead to unfair outcomes in hiring practices, performance evaluations, or resource allocation. To address this, we implement rigorous testing and validation processes in metallurgical environments to identify and mitigate biases in our process control algorithms.

Finally, ethical considerations must extend to the broader societal impact of these technologies in manufacturing. This involves engaging with various stakeholders, including employees, communities, regulators, and customers, to understand their concerns and perspectives. We maintain open dialogue and collaboration to help identify potential ethical issues early on and develop strategies to address them. By fostering a culture of ethical awareness and responsibility, we work to ensure that the deployment of these technologies in industrial settings aligns with our broader values and contributes positively to humanity.

## Perspectives on the Advancement of Manufacturing

We add thoughts to this list continuously, on topics related to method or market:

- Simplicity is king.
- The increasing role of industrial robotics and automation offers potential to streamline operational processes at the systems level and we will develop / lean in to that.
- Robotics technology in and of itself is not state-of-the-art, the principles of [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics) sometimes offer better solutions and can replace or eliminate a robot.
- The importance of adopting sustainable practices at process and at system [is imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change), and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) interoperability is important to customers.
- Innovations in efficient manufacturing processes and the reduction of resultant [carbon footprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint) is an important factor and should be considered in any element of design.
- Flexible manufacturing systems that can adapt to changing market and geopolical demands are important for manufacturers of tooling to consider, and to design for.
- We need to move from a world of static, fixed tooling approaches that are unable to adapt for long-term production resilience to agile, intelligent systems.
- [Additive manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing) can deliver incomparable levels of efficiency and support significantly more complex designs in practice that expand the reaches of human experience.
- In addition, additive manufacturing will exist as a dominant form of any serious manufacturing that occurs off-world or in environments where power is sparse or costly to access.
- 3D printing is primitive as an industry, and is currently delinated to specific parts or components, lacking a mature and unified process that has general purpose capability.
- Infrastructure should be minimized, product should necessitate what is necessary and not amount to the realm of building or power level modifications.
- It is failure on arrival to go for the 'low-hanging' fruit in this industry. Either hold your metallurgical standards to the highest, that being [AWS D17.1 Class A](https://pubs.aws.org/Download_PDFS/AWS_D17_1M_D17_1_2017_AMD2_PV.pdf), or quit.
- Capability is built broadly by printers, capability is built specifically by process. A lack of focus on process first leads (in most other cases) to replaceable printers.
- There are too many 3D printing companies and too few doing any root problem resolution, and by extension that which does will simultaneously obsolete and own the market.

We recognize the critical shortcomings that have plagued the 3D printing industry historically and think part of transparency is understanding these rather than denying them with the idea that will sell more product. The harsh truth is that most, if not all approaches within 3D printing have been restricted by a limited range of materials; we addressed this barrier by developing not another new printer, but an entirely new way to 3D print a metal that supports a far broader spectrum of metals and alloys. The Induction Overture Nacelle (ION), carried on the Halo architecture is engineered for greater material versatility, opening up new possibilities for general purpose use and cross-industry capabilities.

Traditionally high costs of 3D printing, including not just that of machines, but also that of materials, infrastructure and maintenance have hindered widespread adoption. Our technology conversely is built upon the hallmarks of power efficiency and simplicity. Our scalable solutions support more favorable cost-benefit implementations, making metal 3D printing economically viable for a broader range of industries, and for the first time viable in heavy industrial sectors. Our systems produce heavyweight components with superior mechanical properties and structural integrity, suitable for extremely demanding applications in aerospace, naval, and defense.

Rosotics is committed to sustainable manufacturing practices. Our technology reduces waste through precise material usage and significantly more energy-efficient processes. We continuously strive to minimize our environmental footprint, contributing to a more sustainable future for the manufacturing industry. The lack of industry-wide standards and certifications has been a barrier to the adoption of 3D printing. We actively participate in industry consortiums to help advocate for and adhere to far more rigorous standards, ensuring our technologies meet appropriately demanding quality and safety requirements.

## What we aren't

We do not contract manufacture parts, we engineer creators.
